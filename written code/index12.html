<h1>Clipping Paths</h1>
<p>clipping paths restrict drawing to a particular area of the canvas. Think of  a clipping paths as masks
areas where the mask is empty show through, while areas where the mask is opaque do not.</p>
<p>Any path can be clipping path. You simply draw the path as normal and then call the context's clip()
    function to create one.</p>
